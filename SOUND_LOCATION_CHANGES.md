# Sound Notifications and Location Deletion Feature Changes

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to address two key issues:
1. Disabling notification sounds that were playing every 10 seconds during location updates
2. Implementing location deletion functionality (both individual and batch delete options)

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled Notification Sounds

#### File: `lib/services/location_service.dart`
- **Modified notification configurations** to explicitly disable sounds by adding `sound: false` to all notification settings

#### File: `android/app/src/main/res/xml/notification_channels.xml`
- **Created new XML configuration file** to define notification channels that disable sound at the Android system level

### 2. Location Deletion Functionality

#### File: `lib/services/location_service.dart`
- **Added methods for location deletion:**
  - `deleteLocations(List<int> locationIds)` for deleting specific locations
  - `deleteAllLocations()` for clearing all location history

#### File: `lib/widgets/location_card.dart`
- **Added delete button** to the location card widget:
  - Modified the constructor to accept a delete callback
  - Added delete button in the UI with appropriate styling

## Benefits of These Changes
